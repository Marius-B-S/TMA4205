Numerical linear algebra - Autumn 2024

## Course content:
The course focuses on iterative techniques for solving large sparse linear systems of equations which typically stem from the discretisation of partial differential equations. In addition, computation of eigenvalues, least square problems and error analysis will be discussed.

## Projects
* Project 1: Using finite difference methods, solve the heat equation for a non-rectangular domain with given boundary conditions and solving the linear system (without solvers form libraries) using different iterative methods.
